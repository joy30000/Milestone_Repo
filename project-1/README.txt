In this peoject there a "+" icon on the right of the navbar when you click on it a div will expand where
you have to fill a form basically its acts like a pop up window

The form includes four input fields
1. blog post url: This project is done on PWskills lab so i have no access to my device storage thats why
                  you have to paste the link of the image which is located on another server  .

After filling the rest of the fields click on "addblog" button . It will add your blog.

When you click on "readmore" button instead of going to new page the blog thumbnail card will expand
on this page making the background opacity 0 and you can read the full blog on that expanded blog card div


The output images are in the output folder
